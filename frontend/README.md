### Notes for contribution
- All vue file names are written in **PascalCase** "Ex. SignUp".
- vue files are divided inside view and components folders into folders according to their functionality.
- Use the convention for component tags in templates -> seperated by "-" (Ex. \<sign-up-form> for the **SignUpForm** component)
- javaScript follows the **camelCase** naming convention as usual.
- Give the routers "name" properties the same name as the component itself.


### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
